# DsPy Lead Parser to Extract demographic Info

## Overview

In this notebook we have successfully implemented a Lead Parser using the DsPy library. 

DSPy emphasizes programming over prompting. It unifies techniques for prompting and fine-tuning LMs as well as improving them with reasoning and tool/retrieval augmentation, all expressed through a minimalistic set of Pythonic operations that compose and learn.

DSPy provides composable and declarative modules for instructing LMs in a familiar Pythonic syntax. On top of that, DSPy introduces an automatic compiler that teaches LMs how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. The DSPy compiler will internally trace your program and then craft high-quality prompts for large LMs (or train automatic finetunes for small LMs) to teach them the steps of your task.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with the required packages. You can install the necessary packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables

This notebook requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in your environment. You can set it by adding the following line to your environment variables:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
```

## Usage

1. Set up your environment by installing the required packages and setting the environment variable.
2. Open the notebook and follow the instructions provided in each cell to execute the code and analyze YouTube data.

## Summary

- **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Set Environment Variable:** `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'`
- **Run the Notebook:** Open and execute the cells in the notebook to parse lead data.
